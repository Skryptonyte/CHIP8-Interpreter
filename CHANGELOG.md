# Release 1.0.0

  * Display of all the CHIP 8 registers below the display output
  * Instruction Fx18 implemented. Sound Timer however is effectively a stub and behaves just like the Delay Timer for the time being until I figure out low level audio programming.
  * HiRes mode added (64x64 display)
  * Preliminary Super Chip-8 addition: 128x64 display mode
